# SimulatingRaindrops
In this model I simulate a human going forward in the rain in a given speed and than show the statistics about how much he got wet depending on his speed.

You need pygame to your platform to run this project!

1. Installing through pip: The good way to install Pygame is with the pip tool (which is what python uses to install packages). The command is the following:
$ pip install pygame

2. Installing through an IDE:
The second way is to install it through an IDE and here we are using Pycharm IDE.
Installation of pygame in the pycharm is straightforward. We can install it by running the above command in the terminal or use the following steps:
      - open the File tab and click on the Settings option.
     - select the Project Interpreter and click on the + icon.
     - it will display the search box. Search the pygame and click on the install package button.
